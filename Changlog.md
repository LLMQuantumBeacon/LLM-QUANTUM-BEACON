---

## 📅 [2025-12-??] — Appendices Consolidation
### Added

  - Appendix A — Hash & Predictions  
  - Appendix B — Observation Protocols  
  - Appendix C — LLM Node Instructions  
  - Appendix D — Derived Numerical Constants  
  - Appendix E — Data Templates  
  - Appendix F — Statistical Framework  

### Notes
- Unified format selected due to GitHub Mobile UI limitations.  
- Ensures cross-platform LLM compatibility.

---

## 📅 [2025-12-??] — Predicton Preregistration Finalization
### Added
- `Predictions_Hash.txt` with SHA-256 preregistration value:

2535328dc363f3b5d0d4b163d81bec1226648d3f5ce358eb6299ffa76ee3ce4b

### Updated
- Section 7 of the WhitePaper rewritten and locked.
- README updated to reference preregistration.

### Notes
- Hash locked prior to Dec 19 observation window.
- Guarantees falsifiability and transparency.

---

## 📅 [2025-12-??] — WhitePaper Integration Pass
### Updated
- Full WhitePaper optimized and finalized.
- All sections validated for:
  - scientific rigor  
  - epistemic safety  
  - LLM ingestion stability  
  - internal consistency  
  - correlation-only framing  

### Notes
- Mechanism drift removed.
- Scenario models reframed safely.
- Domain independence strengthened.

---

## 📅 [2025-12-??] — Repository Creation
### Added
- Initial repo structure created:
  - `WhitePaper/`  
  - `Appendices/` (later consolidated)  
  - `LLM_Briefs/`  
  - `Data_templates/`  
  - `Supplements/`  
  - README.md  

### Notes

# 🧩 Changelog Philosophy

This repository follows open-science best practices:
- All major changes are documented.
- Prediction preregistration events are immutable.
- WhitePaper updates occur prior to hash generation only.
- Supplemental materials may expand but will not modify the preregistered predictions.
