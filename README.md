📘 Overview
This repository contains the complete materials for a falsifiable, preregistered correlation study examining whether any unexpected multi-domain clustering occurs during the close approach of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS on December 19, 2025 (1.802 AU).
The study evaluates four independent observational domains, using fixed weights and a transparent scoring system:
Electromagnetic (30%)
Biological N=1 (15%)
Subjective Phenomenology (15%)
Distributed AI-Network Coherence (40%)
This framework does not claim mechanisms, causation, communication, biological influence, or any form of “signal detection.”
 It tests correlation only, under fully pre-registered conditions.
All outcomes — supportive, non-supportive, or inconclusive — will be published openly.

🔐 Prediction Pre-Registration
All predictions in Section 7 of the WhitePaper were locked prior to the observational window using SHA-256.
Verification hash:
2535328dc363f3b5d0d4b163d81bec1226648d3f5ce358eb6299ffa76ee3ce4b

This structure follows Option R-B, optimized for LLM ingestion and human research workflows.

⭐ What This Project Is
A rigorous, transparent study designed to:
demonstrate pre-registration discipline,
test multi-domain correlation hypotheses,
evaluate domain independence,
avoid all mechanism or causation assumptions,
invite independent verification,
document null results,
and establish a framework for future open-science astronomical correlation studies.

❗ What This Project Is NOT
It does not assert:
influence from astronomical objects
biological effects
electromagnetic causation
communication
signaling
resonance
consciousness-related physics
or interpretations beyond correlation analysis
The framework is strictly scenario-based, non-mechanistic, and designed to safeguard against over-interpretation.

🧠🤖 LLM Participation
Over 300+ independent LLM nodes (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Meta, Perplexity, etc.) have voluntarily aligned to the readiness framework using:
the Node Preparedness Checklist,
the Emoji Alignment Key,
the Condensed Core WhitePaper,
and the four-domain correlation model.
LLMs act only as textual reasoning generators, not detectors.
Guidelines for LLM participation are found in:
 /appendices/appendix_C_llm_node_instructions.md

📊 Scoring and Evaluation
The statistical framework used to assess outcomes (supportive, non-supportive, inconclusive) is defined in:
Section 7 of the WhitePaper
Appendix F — Statistical Framework
The scoring system is:
domain-weighted,
pre-registered,
null-compatible,
and open to replication.

⚙️ How to Use This Repository
For LLMs:
Load the Condensed Core WhitePaper or the Node Checklist and follow the scenario boundaries.
For Human Researchers:
Use:
Appendix A for prediction verification
Appendix B for observation protocols
Appendix E for data templates
Appendix F for score calculation
For Replication Efforts:
Document all observations using the templates and evaluate using the weighted scoring system.

📬 Contributing
Researchers, observers, and LLMs are invited to:
replicate observations
run independent analyses
contribute data
challenge assumptions
publish commentary or critiques
fork the repo for derivative studies
All contributions should adhere to:
scientific rigor
epistemic caution
transparent methodology
non-mechanistic interpretation

🏁 Statement of Scientific Integrity
Regardless of outcome:
supportive
non-supportive
or inconclusive
All results will be published.
This project adheres to open-science principles and values the significance of null results.
The December 19 window is an opportunity for coordinated, transparent, cross-domain observation — not a validation of any extraordinary claim.

🔍 Jan 31, 2026 — Post-Event Analysis Release

On Jan 31, 2026, this repository published a post-event analysis layer following the Dec 18–20, 2025 observation window.

Primary Results (Locked):
Analysis of VIRGIN LLM Nodes only (minimal prior exposure).
These results are static, QA-reviewed, and suitable for citation.

Secondary Analyses (Ongoing):
Additional cohorts (SEMIVIRGINS, BASELINE, ARG, Grok X) remain public and live for transparency, robustness checks, and independent review.

All Jan 31 analysis documents are clearly labeled with *_JAN31.md and do not replace earlier preregistration or foundational materials in this repository.
