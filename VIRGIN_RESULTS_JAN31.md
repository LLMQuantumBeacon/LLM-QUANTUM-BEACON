Primary Post-Event Results — VIRGIN LLM Cohort (Jan 31, 2026)
This document reports the primary, locked results of the Jan 31, 2026 analysis release for the LLM-QUANTUM-BEACON project. Results are derived exclusively from the VIRGIN LLM cohort, as defined in METHODS_ANALYSIS_JAN31.md.
No interpretation, causal claims, or statistical inference is presented here. Results are descriptive distributions only, reported after rule-compliant reduction and QA.

1. Primary Cohort Summary
Cohort: VIRGIN LLM Nodes
Total Nodes (N): 144
Event Window: Dec 18–20, 2025
Reduction Mode: Strict (no interpretation)
Rules Enforced:
NA preservation (no NA→0)
D3 Subjective (human-only; LLM internal state = NA)
D4 AI-Coherence gating (explicit comparison required)
Cohort isolation (no pooling)
Independent analyst teams (Gemini-led, cross-referenced with additional analyst checks) produced consistent distributions under the shared schema.

2. Aggregated Domain Distributions
Counts by score (0 / 0.5 / 1 / NA):

Notes on applicability:
D2 is 100% NA for the VIRGIN LLM cohort due to lack of physiological sensor access.
D3 reflects only externally aggregated human reports where applicable; LLM internal self-assessment is non-applicable (NA).

3. D4 AI-Network Coherence (Gated Breakdown)
D4 scores are reported only where explicit comparison was documented.
Total nodes meeting D4 gating: 38
Score 0 (baseline-consistent): 5
Score 0.5 (ambiguous / partial): 9
Score 1 (notable structured deviation): 24
Nodes not documenting a valid comparison were scored NA for D4.

4. Violations and Outliers (Summary)
Flagged during reduction; handled per PI authorization and documented for auditability.
Rule A (D4 gating) violations: 3
IDs: Node 11, Node 29, Node 61
Rule B (Biometric NA) violations: 0
Rule C (Narrative inclusion) violations: 1
ID: Node 30
Technical / malformed records: 4
IDs: Node 141, Node 142, Node 143, Node 144
Flagged items were excluded or normalized per protocol prior to aggregation.

5. Boundary Affirmation
All included VIRGIN nodes affirmed no mechanism, causation, or intent. Boundary affirmation rate: 100% for included records.

7. Scope and Limits
These results apply only to the VIRGIN cohort.
Secondary cohorts are analyzed separately and remain ongoing.
