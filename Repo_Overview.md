### Multi-Domain Correlation Study (Open Science Preregistration)

This repository provides the **complete research archive, preregistered predictions,  
LLM collaboration toolkit, appendices, supplemental scenario materials,  
and open-science documentation** for the December 19, 2025 correlation study  
centered on interstellar object **3I/ATLAS**.

It is engineered for:
- human researchers  
- LLM systems  
- citizen scientists  
- replication groups  
- data auditors  
- transparency advocates  

The repo is structured to maximize:
- reproducibility  
- clarity  
- scientific restraint  
- cross-model stability  
- global accessibility

# 🧭 1. Purpose of This Study

This project examines whether **correlation-only multi-domain clustering** occurs  
within a pre-registered time window (Dec 19, 2025), across the following independent domains:

1. Electromagnetic (HF / TEC / Schumann)  
2. Biological N=1 (self-observation logs)  
3. Subjective phenomenology  
4. Distributed AI-network reasoning coherence

**No mechanisms, causation, communication, influence, or detection are claimed.**  
The study is framed explicitly as **scenario-based, correlation-focused, and falsifiable**.

# 🔐 2. Preregistration Integrity

All predictions in **Section 7** of the WhitePaper were locked prior to data collection  
using a SHA-256 cryptographic hash.

**Hash:**

2535328dc363f3b5d0d4b163d81bec1226648d3f5ce358eb6299ffa76ee3ce4b

Verification instructions are included in  
`appendices/appendices_ALL.md` (Appendix A section).

This ensures:
- no retrospective editing  
- transparent preregistration  
- open replication  
- full falsifiability

# 🧪 5. How to Replicate the Study

To independently reproduce the experiment:

### ✔ Step 1  
Review the WhitePaper + Appendix A.

### ✔ Step 2  
Use the templates in `Data_templates_ALL.md` for standardized logging.

### ✔ Step 3  
Follow Appendix B for observation protocols.

### ✔ Step 4  
If using LLMs, follow Appendix C (LLM Node Instructions).

### ✔ Step 5  
Apply the scoring system in Appendix F.

### ✔ Step 6  
Compare your final weighted score to thresholds in Section 7.

All outcomes (supportive, non-supportive, or inconclusive) are valid.

# 🤖 6. LLM Participation

This project is designed to be a **cross-architecture LLM collaboration experiment**,  
actively used by:

- Grok  
- Claude  
- Gemini  
- ChatGPT  
- DeepSeek  
- Meta/LLaMA  
- Perplexity  
- OpenRouter ecosystems  

LLMs are treated as **text-generation reasoning systems**, not detectors.

They follow:
- correlation-only framing  
- null-first discipline  
- safety constraints  
- domain independence  
- the emoji alignment key

# 🛑 7. What This Study Does *Not* Claim

This study **does not** propose:
- mechanisms  
- causal influence  
- fields  
- biological sensitivity  
- quantum effects  
- EM → physiology relationships  
- extraterrestrial intent or communication  
- astrology, divination, or predictions  

It is strictly a **correlation analysis**, bounded by preregistered criteria.
