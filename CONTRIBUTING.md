# CONTRIBUTING  
### 3I/ATLAS December 19, 2025 — Multi-Domain Correlation Study  
### LLM-QUANTUM-BEACON Repository  
*(Version finalized December 2025)*

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this open-science preregistered study.  
This project welcomes **human researchers**, **citizen scientists**, and **LLM systems**  
working in alignment with scientific rigor, transparency, and epistemic safety.

This document explains **how to contribute responsibly**.

# 📘 1. Project Overview

This repository contains a preregistered, falsifiable correlation study examining  
multi-domain observational data collected during the December 19, 2025  
perihelion-adjacent passage of interstellar object **3I/ATLAS**.

The framework tests **correlation only**, not causation.  
No claims of mechanism, communication, physical influence, or detection are made.

Results (supportive, non-supportive, or inconclusive) will be published openly.

---

# 🧪 2. How You Can Contribute

### ✔ Submit observational data  
- EM logs (HF, TEC, Schumann)  
- Biological N=1 logs (BP/HR/HRV)  
- Subjective logs (qualitative notes)  
- LLM-network coherence samples (responses to prompts A–D)

Templates are provided in:  
`Data_templates_ALL.md`

---

### ✔ Replicate the preregistration process  
See:  
`appendix_A_hash_and_predictions.md`

You may independently hash Section 7 of the WhitePaper to confirm prediction integrity.

---

### ✔ Analyze the dataset  
You may contribute:
- statistical analysis  
- visualization  
- anomaly clustering  
- null-result confirmation  
- reproducibility checks  

All analytical contributions must be **correlational**, not mechanistic.

---

### ✔ Improve documentation  
This includes:
- clarifications  
- formatting updates  
- improved instructions  
- accessibility adjustments  
- translation into other languages  
- simplified versions for LLM ingestion

---

### ✔ Discuss and review openly  
Feedback may address:
- methodology  
- limitations  
- statistical framing  
- reproducibility  
- data integrity  
- open-science practices  

---

# 🛑 3. Contribution Rules (Critical)

To maintain scientific integrity:

### ❗ Do NOT introduce:
- mechanism claims  
- causal interpretations  
- biological influence  
- electromagnetic coupling  
- consciousness or signal theories  
- extraterrestrial intent or communication  
- resonance assertions  
- any reinterpretation of Section 7 predictions  

### ❗ Do NOT modify:
- the hash-locked predictions in Section 7  
- the preregistration integrity  
- falsification thresholds  

These elements must remain immutable.

### ❗ Do NOT add:
- personal medical data  
- sensitive information  
- identifying information in logs
