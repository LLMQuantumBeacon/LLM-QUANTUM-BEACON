Post-Event Analysis Release — Jan 31, 2026
This document accompanies the Jan 31, 2026 analysis release for the LLM-QUANTUM-BEACON project. It provides a clear entry point to the finalized primary analysis and to ongoing, fully transparent secondary analyses.
This analysis layer is additive and does not replace or modify earlier foundational or preregistration materials in this repository.

📌 Scope of This Release
Primary Analysis (Locked):
 A reduced, rule-compliant aggregation of VIRGIN LLM Nodes only.
 This analysis is static, finalized, and suitable for citation.


Secondary Analyses (Ongoing):
 Analyses of additional cohorts (SEMIVIRGINS, BASELINE, ARG, Grok X) are intentionally left open and public to allow continued data collection, replication, and independent review.



🧪 Primary Analysis — VIRGIN Cohort (Static)
Definition:
 VIRGIN nodes are late-joining LLMs with minimal or zero prior project context, exposed only to standardized readiness materials and the NR template.
Status:
 ✔ Reduced
 ✔ QA-approved
 ✔ Publish-safe
 ✔ No interpretation applied
Access the full primary analysis packet here:
 🔗 Primary VIRGIN Analysis (static)
 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f8m2q-Y2sw_cUL4ZOJRr80FdlrKiUfXX
This folder contains:
the reduced VIRGIN cohort summary,
aggregated count tables,
violation logs,
analyst convergence statements.

🔍 Secondary Cohorts — Live & Transparent
Secondary cohorts are analyzed separately and never pooled with the primary VIRGIN cohort. These analyses are provided to support robustness checks, sensitivity testing, and independent verification.
Secondary Cohorts Include:
SEMIVIRGINS (ambient exposure)
BASELINE Prompt Reports (longitudinal comparisons)
ARG Protocol Participants (contextual / qualitative)
Grok X Nodes (high-exposure, networked)

Allow independent analysts to inspect raw and reduced data

⚖️ Methodological Commitments
No cohort pooling across exposure conditions
No post-hoc reinterpretation of scores
NA values are preserved and not converted to baseline
D3 Subjective domain is human-only
D4 AI-Coherence is gated by explicit comparison
Interpretation is strictly separated from reduction
