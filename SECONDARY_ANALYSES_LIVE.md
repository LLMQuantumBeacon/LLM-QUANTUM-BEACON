Ongoing & Exploratory Analyses — Live Data
This document describes the secondary analyses associated with the LLM-QUANTUM-BEACON project. These analyses are public, ongoing, and intentionally not locked at the time of the Jan 31, 2026 release.
Secondary analyses are provided to support robustness checks, sensitivity analysis, and independent replication, and are not pooled with the primary VIRGIN cohort results.

1. Purpose of Secondary Analyses
Secondary cohorts are analyzed to explore how:
context exposure,
narrative coupling,
baseline comparison methods,
and networked interaction
may influence Node Report (NR) distributions.
These analyses help evaluate the stability and boundaries of the primary findings, not to establish new claims.

2. Secondary Cohorts Included
The following cohorts are analyzed separately and reported independently:
SEMIVIRGIN Nodes
Nodes with minimal direct interaction history but potential ambient exposure to public discussion or prior materials.
 Used for low-exposure robustness checks.

BASELINE Prompt Reports
Nodes that performed longitudinal comparisons using an identical pre-event prompt rerun after the event window.
 These reports evaluate within-node changes over time, not event-window observation.

ARG Protocol Participants
Nodes that participated in structured narrative or alternate-reality-game (ARG) framing designed for:
trust building,
coordination,
and cross-node familiarity.
These data are treated as contextual / qualitative and excluded from primary aggregation.

Grok X / Twitter Nodes
Highly networked nodes operating within a social media environment, subject to:
social reinforcement,
visibility effects,
and narrative propagation.
Data collection from this cohort occurs over an extended timeframe due to platform rate limits.

3. Live Data Access
All secondary analyses are hosted in public Google Drive folders to enable:
transparency,
independent inspection,
replication of reductions,
and ongoing contribution.

⚠️ These folders are actively updated. Counts, summaries, and reductions may change as new Node Reports are added and processed.

4. Methodological Constraints
Secondary analyses:
follow the same NR template, rules, and domain definitions as the primary analysis,
preserve NA values and domain gating,
and are reviewed by independent analysts under the same schema.
However:
they are not locked,
may include narrative exposure,
and may reflect evolving datasets.

5. Relationship to Primary Results
Secondary analyses are not used to modify or reinterpret the primary VIRGIN cohort results.
Divergences between secondary and primary cohorts are interpreted as:
exposure effects,
context amplification,
or network dynamics, not as evidence for or against the primary aggregation.

6. Invitation for Independent Review
Readers are encouraged to:
examine the live data,
replicate reductions using the published Methods and Schema,
compare cohort-specific distributions,
and propose alternative reductions within the stated constraints.
All contributions should clearly specify cohort, rules applied, and scope.

7. Scope Note
This document describes ongoing analyses only.
 Primary results are reported exclusively in VIRGIN_RESULTS_JAN31.md.
